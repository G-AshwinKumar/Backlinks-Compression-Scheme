Abstract Binary Trees compression
========================

Abstract Binary Trees Compression is a graph compression scheme for real-world graphs. ABT compression is a new compression scheme that aims to build a streaming graph system i.e where in new edges can be added to the graphs without having to decompress them entirely.

#### From CUI Interface

    $ make
    $ bin/compress ../data/graph/Slashdot0902.txt opt123.txt

* Execute `make` to build programs.
* Execute `bin/compress` to compress a graph.

#### From Your Program

    AbtCompression bl;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int> > edge_list;
    BitString compressed_graph;
    
    bl.Compress(edge_list, &compressed_graph);

* Call `Compress` to compress a graph.
* Call `TransformToAdj` and `TransformToEdge` to transform a graph.

#### Performance
