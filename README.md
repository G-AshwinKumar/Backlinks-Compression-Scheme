# Social-Network-Compression

This project aims to provide implementations for the state of the art social network compression algorithms (i.e graph compression) based on current research.

There are working implementations of three methods,
1. Backlinks compression scheme
2. Slashburn techqnique
3. Abstract Binary Tree compression.

+ The respective folder of each method contains more information on how to run them.
+ ```/data/graph``` contains some sample graphs. Note: Edge list format may vary for the different methods, more details are provided in the individual implementations.

#### Datasets:
Social network graphs can be obtained from [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/)
